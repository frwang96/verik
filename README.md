# Verik

Verik is a Hardware Description Language embedded in Kotlin that compiles transparently to SystemVerilog. It aims to
improve the syntax and environment support for SystemVerilog while maintaining its core semantics in order to bring
modern software tools and methodologies to hardware design.
